Research Question
What are the key predictive features of the Formula 1 Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships, and can these features predict the next winner of the Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships?

Executive Summary
This project aims to predict the next winner of the Formula 1 Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships by developing a logistic regression model. The model is designed to identify the next Drivers' World Champion with an accuracy of X% and the next Constructors' World Champion with an accuracy of X%. By analysing the results and statistics from the past five years, key predictors such as X, X, and X have been identified. The insights derived from the model offer a compelling perspective on the competitiveness of the sport in the modern era.
